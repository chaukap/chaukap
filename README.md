## I'm Chandler (He/Him), a software developer and aspiring software engineer. 
Here's a little about my Journey.

**I began programming my freshman year** at the University of Wyoming. My junior year, I began working for the [Dryland Ecology Group](https://github.com/DrylandEcology) where I worked on their ecological model, [STEPWAT2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2), and their R wrapper program, [RSFSTEP2](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSFSTEP2). I also competed in the [National Cyber League competition](https://github.com/chaukap/NCL-2019-Fall).

**After graduating, I started working for [Underwriters Labs](https://www.ul.com/)**. I was a software developer for internal applications, where privacy and data consistency are key. I've learned from some of the best developers around and become advanced in databasing, web development, and UX design.

**I decided to further my education** by enrolling in the [MIDS program at UC Berkeley](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/). I finished the program in August of this year and am actively applying to psoitions. I haven't compiled a large body of work yet, but a few of my statistical analysis and meachine learning examples can be found in my [projects repository](https://github.com/chaukap/Projects). I'm specifically interested in sprivacy enhancing technologies and completed my [capstone project](https://simpledifferentialprivacy.com) on differential privacy.

**When I'm not studying,** I enjoy hiking, snowshoing, plantkeeping and playing the ukulele (at least, trying to play the ukulele 😉). 

**My next steps are** to transition into a software or data engineering role. Add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandler-haukap/) if you think I'd be a good fit at your organization!
